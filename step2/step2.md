# Age Calculator

In this step we'll write a simple programme to calculate someone's age if you know their year of birth. (OK, I know you don't really need a computer to do this, but it will help to show some important ways that Python carries out certain tasks.)

## input()

Before we go on let's introduce another important Python function: ```input()``` which is used to get information from the computer user.

You can try this out in your first ever Python code project. Type

``` python
input("What's your name?")
```

and click on Run. In the results panel you will see it has printed **What's your name?** and after that is a flashing black rectangle. That means the code is waiting for you ty type in something. But before you start to type ***CLICK YOUR MOUSE ONCE INSIDE THE RESULTS PANEL***. This is to shift the focus of trinket to the results panel. If start typing without doing this, trinket will assume you are still editing your code, so whatever you type will appear in the code and will probably cause an error. You can easily remove anything you typed by accident in the code using the keys Cntl-Z, for *undo*.

The phrase inside the brackets in the ```input()``` function is called a *prompt string*.

(Did you notice I used *double* quotes for my prompt string above? That's because my string includes an apostrophe in the word **What's**. If you tried to use single quotes Python would think this apostrophe was a single quote mark which would indicate the end of the string.)

When you're ready, go on to [the next step](../step3/step3.md) and start learning Python graphics!
