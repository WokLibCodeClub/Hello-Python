# First ever Python code

Use trinket to open a new project - this will be your first Python code, so give your project a name to show this.

The trinket window has two parts - to the left is the *coding panel* where you write your code; to the right is the *results panel* where the output of your code appears.

In Python code a lot of the words you type are followed by brackets: ```()``` and sometimes there are things typed inside the brackets, and sometimes they are empty.

When a word in Python is followed by brackets it means it is a Python ***function*** which means it carries out some action for us. At first we will use functions written by someone else, but later we will write our own functions.

## print()

The first function to use is the Python ```print()``` function, which causes something to be printed in the results panel.

Make sure the first line of your project has this code:

``` python
#!/bin/python3
```

then, in the next line, type

``` python
print('Hello')
```

(Make sure you include the quote marks around the word Hello.)

Click on the triangle labelled **Run** and see what happens.

Now change the single quote marks ```'``` to double quote marks ```"``` and see what happens.

Python calls letters and/or numbers inside quote marks a *text string*. A text string is a type of Python *object*. Python lets you use single quotes or double quotes to make a text string. 

Many Python functions let you put more than one thing inside the brackets, and in this case you have to separate the different items with a comma ```,```. Try

``` python
print('Taylor', 'Swift')
```

You will see it prints one text string after the other (and 

We can also use ```print()``` to print numbers. 

``` python
print(5)
```

Numbers are a different type of Python object - you can do some things with numbers that you can't do with text strings, and vice versa.
