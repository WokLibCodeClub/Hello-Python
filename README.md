# Hello-Python

This is a short course to introduce Python coding to those who have never used it before. It starts with the very basic commands and works upwards.

These pages are written using the online editor [trinket](https://trinket.io), so to get the most out of this course you should have a trinket account. You can create one by going to [https://trinket.io/signup](https://trinket.io/signup). You will need an email address to be able to create an account.

## Using the trinket editor

If you are not familiar with using trinket then you should look at the instructions [here](trinket_basics/using_trinket.md) which will show you how to start new projects, see all the projects in your account, and remix other people's projects.

## Python and typing

Python is a text-based programming language, which means that you have to type all your commands, unlike Scratch where you can build up code by dragging blocks. This means that you will enjoy Python coding much more if you are familiar with a computer keyboard and can type the commands quickly without wasting too much time looking for the right letters. The best thing for Python coders is to learn proper touch-typing, using all your fingers. There are lots of online courses teaching you to touch-type, but one which is a lot of fun is on the BBC bitesize website and is called [Dance Mat Typing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z3c6tfr). Why not give it a try?
