# Using the trinket online editor

We have found that the *Google Chrome* and *Microsoft Edge* browsers work well with trinket. Unfortunately, *Mozilla Firefox* doesn't seem to work so well, so we would advise you to avoid this browser.

## Logging in

Go the the trinket home page at [trinket.io](https:\\trinket.io),  click on **Log In**, and enter your username and password. This will take you to your home page:

## Looking at all your trinket projects

Click on the little downward-pointing arrow next to your username, and select *My Trinkets*:
