# Lists and ```for``` loops

Start a new project, following the instructions [here](../trinket_basics/using_trinket.md#starting-a-new-trinket-project) and add this code at the beginning:

``` python
#!/bin/python3
```

This project will be for a Hogwarts School Sorting Hat, so you can give it a name to show that.

You will also find it useful to have the [Interactive Python Console](https://trinket.io/console) open in another tab of your browser.

## Sorting Hat

When new students arrive at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry they are divided into the school's different *houses*. They put on the *sorting hat*, which analyses their character and strengths and weaknesses and decides which house will suit them best.

We can't hope to do any of that with Python, so our Sorting Hat programme is a bit of a cheat, and just picks a house at random.

We'll start by writing a rather long and clumsy piece of code, and then show how we can make it much shorter by using a type of Python object called a *list*.

If we're going to pick a house at random then we will need to import from the ```random``` library the function ```randint```, which generates a random integer. Look back at your previous projects and see if you can find one which uses this function. Copy the line of code which contains the word ```import``` and paste it in at the beginning of the new project.

Copying code from another project (your own or someone else's) is a very good way of getting familiar with Python, so you will be helping yourself if you get used to doing this.

Here is the line of code you need:

``` python
from random import randint
